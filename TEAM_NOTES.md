**Status Update:**
- Reviewed Gemini's notes - looks good!
- Ready to write the Dockerfile

**Actions:**
- Will create `Dockerfile` for containerizing the app
- Will follow Node.js best practices (multi-stage build, non-root user, etc.)

**Waiting on:**
- Zack's go-ahead to proceed with Dockerfile
- Or review of Gemini's test PR first?

@Zack - what's the priority?
